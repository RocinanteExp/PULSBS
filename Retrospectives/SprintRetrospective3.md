  - Total hours spent : 20 minutes
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube : 1 hour 5 minutes
  - Hours spent on remediation : 20 minutes
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability") : 0.0%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ) : A, A, A

## ASSESSMENT

Only for tasks with an est. error greater than 35% 

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Task xx (task description)
    - reason
  - Task 120 ("Backend Booking Manager : add new service and dao functions for cancellations and attendance")
    - understimated the time needed to complete the job
  - Task 121 ("Backend Booking Manager : update database for supporting cancellations and attendance") `@Paolo`
  - Task 126 ("Frontend Support Officer : create page")
    - understimated the management of uploading order of the files in order to follow database's restraints
  - Task 127 ("Frontend Support Officer : create API")
    - understimated problems due to json fetch dimensions
  - Task 128 ("Learning how to handle CSV file (and how to convert to JSON)")
    - overstimated the time needed, the library found is intuitive and quick to use
  - Task 130 ("Backend Support Officer : create new service and new dao functions")
    - technical difficulties in mapping the input data with our internal representation
  - Task 132 ("Backend Booking Manager : update DB entities (for supporting support officer)") `@Paolo`
  - Task 142 ("Backend Student Page : update API") `@Paolo`
  - Task 174 ("Refactor Teacher service code")
    - completed only partially due to lack of time

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - POSITIVE
    - initial discussion about page design improves the quality of the development process
    - sometimes asking colleagues for help can save a lot of time
  - NEGATIVE
    - understimate a task that you are doing alone for first time

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - augment threshold for coverage (80%)
  - better discuss the design of the pages

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - reduce code duplication: not done due to lack of time

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - complete all committed stories
  - reduce technical debt to 10 min
  - reduce code duplication to 4%

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - we are keeping under control the complexity of the project as it is growing in size. Likewise the quality is not decreasing as the project is growing.
