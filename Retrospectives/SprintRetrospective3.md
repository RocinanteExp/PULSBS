## ASSESSMENT DA FARE

Only for tasks with an est. error greater than 35% 

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Task xx (task description)
    - reason
  - Task 120 ("Backend Booking Manager : add new service and dao functions for cancellations and attendance")
    - understimated the time needed to complete the job
  - Task 130 ("Backend Support Officer : create new service and new dao functions")
    - technical difficulties in mapping the input data with our internal representation
  - Task 174 ("Refactor Teacher service code")
    - completed only partially due to lack of time

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - POSITIVE
  - NEGATIVE

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - augment threshold for coverage (80%)
  - better discuss the design of the pages
  - reduce code duplication

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
