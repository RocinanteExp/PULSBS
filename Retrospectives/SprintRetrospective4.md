SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE 3 (TEAM 4)
=====================================

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done :
- Total points committed vs done :
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) :
- Unit Tests passing :
- Code review completed :
- Code present on VCS : x lines
- End-to-End tests performed :

### Detailed statistics

| story | points | task | time est | time act | Assignee               | est error > 35%      | status |
| ----- | ------ | ---- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------ |

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
  - average: 
  - standard deviation: 

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table
  - error ratio: 

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 
  - Total hours spent : 
  - Nr of automated unit test cases:
    - Client-side : 
    - Server-side : 
  - Coverage : 
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 
  - Total hours spent : 
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated : 10h
  - Total hours spent : 5h 40m
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated : 25m
  - Total hours spent : 25m
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube : 1h
  - Hours spent on remediation : 25m
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability") : 0.0%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ) : A, A, A

## ASSESSMENT

Only for tasks with an est. error greater than 35% 

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Task xx (task description)
    - reason
- Task 190	(PULSBS-18 Frontend TeacherPage : add new API)
	- The task was actually faster then expected, but we preferred to estimate it with a bit of margin. 
- Task 192	(PULSBS-18 Frontend TeacherPage : test new API)
	- The task was actually faster then expected, but we preferred to estimate it with a bit of margin. 

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
<!-- OLD THINGS
  - POSITIVE
    - initial discussion about page design improves the quality of the development process
    - sometimes asking colleagues for help can save a lot of time
  - NEGATIVE
    - understimate a task that you are doing alone for first time
-->

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

  - complete all committed stories

<!-- OLD THINGS
  - augment threshold for coverage (80%)
  - better discuss the design of the pages
-->

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

  - reduce technical debt to 10 min: a lot of new code committed, so it required an high effort to keep the technical debt stable
  - reduce code duplication to 4%: not done due to lack of time
<!-- OLD THINGS
  - reduce code duplication: not done due to lack of time
-->

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
<!-- OLD THINGS
  - complete all committed stories
  - reduce technical debt to 10 min
  - reduce code duplication to 4%
-->

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
<!-- OLD THINGS
  - we are keeping under control the complexity of the project as it is growing in size. Likewise the quality is not decreasing as the project is growing.
