  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability") : 0.0%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ) : A, A, A

## ASSESSMENT

Only for tasks with an est. error greater than 35% 

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Task xx (task description)
    - reason
  - Task 176 (Code review)
    - we finished the time budget
  - Task 177 (Review API)
    - The task was actually faster then expected, but we preferred to estimate it with a bit of margin. 
  - Task 181 (Frontend Support Page : test new page)
    - need to implement more test case of those expected 
  - Task 184 (PULSBS-17 Backend Support Page : implement API service)
    - we added a new feature (cancellation) mid sprint
  - Task 187 (PULSBS-17 Backend Support Page : test API service)
      - understimated the time needed to complete the task 
  - Task 190 (PULSBS-18 Frontend TeacherPage : add new API)
     - The task was actually faster then expected, but we preferred to estimate it with a bit of margin. 
  - Task 192 (PULSBS-18 Frontend TeacherPage : test new API)
    - The task was actually faster then expected, but we preferred to estimate it with a bit of margin. 
  - Task 197 (PULSBS-18 Backend Teacher Page : test API service)
      - had to rewrite old tests due to a different implementation of the service
   - Task 199 (Frontend Teacher Page :  update APIs)
     - The task was actually faster then expected, but we preferred to estimate it with a bit of margin. 
   - Task 201 (Frontend Booking Manager : adapt the page)
     - There were issues in graph implementation not expected
   - Task 225 (Update API documentation)
     - we finished the time budget
     
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  
  - POSITIVE
    - initial discussion about page design improves the quality of the development process
    - sometimes asking colleagues for help can save a lot of time
  - NEGATIVE
    

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - complete all committed stories

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

  - reduce technical debt to 10 min: a lot of new code committed, so it required an high effort to keep the technical debt stable
  - reduce code duplication to 4%: not done due to lack of time

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - augment coverage to 95% 
    * increase time budget for related task
  - reduce technical debt to 10 min
    * increase time budget for related task
  - reduce code duplication to 4%
    * increase time budget for related task
  - improve performance 
    * create ad hoc tasks
    
- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  We built a very strong bond among us and this allowed to develope a better application with less effort
