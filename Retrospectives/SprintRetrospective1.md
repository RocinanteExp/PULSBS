SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE 1 (TEAM 4)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done : 4 vs 1
- Total points committed vs done : 29 vs 8
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) : 72h vs 66h 30m

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing :
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD

  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ) : A, A, A
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
