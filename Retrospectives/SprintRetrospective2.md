## ASSESSMENT (da fare)

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Task 27 (Learning testing tools for the frontend)  
    - we thought learning testing tools required a lot of effort, for this reason we overestimated this task
  - Task 48 (frontend implement login page):
    - There was a communication issue with the assignee of this task
  - Task 40 (testing gui student webpage):
    - learning the new tools was easy but implemented the tests in practice required more effort
  - Task 42 (Testing: back-end API related to the student/teacher/login): 
    - there were more use cases than initially predicted, thus it required more time to write the API's tests
  - Task 34 (Implement email sending service)
    - we didn't know how to implement mails with node but it has proved easier than expected
  - Task 36 (Front-end: implement front-end APIs function):
    - after the effort of implementing the first API, the other ones were much faster to do
  - Task 37 (Back-end: implement back-end APIs functions related to retrieving all the students booked for a lecture taught by a particular teacher): 
    - it was tracked an additional part related to setting up the controllers and services routines
  - Task 45 (Testing: back-end API related to retrieving students): 
    - same reason as for task 42
    - it took extra time to readapt the tests after changes were made midway the sprint.
  - Task 46 (Testing: db and queries related to retrieving the students): 
    - more effort needed to integrate other modules with the whole system, no more time for this task. 
  - Task 39 : 
  - Task 47 (Testing: back-end emailfunctions about seat booking): 
    - misunderstanding between team members lead to tracking time issues, such as clocking the work log in other similar tasks.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - POSITIVE
    - automation is your best friend
    - group discussions helps while developing a web application  
    - defining more detailed tasks was a good choice
  - NEGATIVE
    - working in parallel on the same file may cause frustration and annoyance. Those were caused in part by:
      - spending extra time in understanding the code written by other people
      - distinct structure of a problem's solution (good and bad at the same time)
    - not having a coherent set of APIs lead to different implementation styles in some part of the system  
    - testing should not be understimated because it is essential

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - Discuss before making any breaking changes with your
teammates (or at least the people affected by it)
PARTIAL
  - Reflect more in depth about the workload needed by a
task. It is better to divide a task in subtasks if the
estimation it is not clear or well defined.
DONE
  - Define a coherent and a systematic approach for managing
the project folder structure.
DONE

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - Discuss before making any breaking changes with your
teammates (or at least the people affected by it)
    - Lack of proper communication lead to misunderstandings, conflicts in the work.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - do more group discussions
  - code review
  - augment and define threshold for coverage
  - define better APIs

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!  
During this first sprint we built a solid base in our project in order to deploy a very good application at the end!
