> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
  - average: 1,27
  - standard deviation: 1,72

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table
  - error ratio: 0,997

## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 34 hours 30 minutes
  - Total hours spent : 32 hours 30 minutes
  - Nr of automated unit test cases:
    - Client-side : 65 tests
    - Server-side : 103 tests
  - Coverage : 87.50 %
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 3 hours 30 minutes
  - Total hours spent : 3 hours 45 minutes
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated : 10 hours
  - Total hours spent : 10 hours 5 minutes
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated : 25 hours
  - Total hours spent : 10 hours
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube : 1 hour
  - Hours spent on remediation : 10 minutes
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability") : 0.0%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ) : A, A, A

## ASSESSMENT (in progress)

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Task xx (task description)
    - reason
  - Task 44 ("Testing: gui teacher web page"):
    - due to all changes the page received (mostly unexpected ones) during all the sprint the time needed to update tests each time was more than expected
  - Task 54 ("Backend: add server API"):
    - the main effort for this story was in other tasks, overestimated
  - Task 57 ("Backend : testing the new Dao and service function"):
    - repeatitive operations, overestimated
  - Task 58 ("Backend: testing delete booking server API"):
    - there were more use cases to consider to reach the min coverage threshold
  - Task 73 ("Backend: add function that notify the student when a lecture is cancelled"):
    - the notification system was not straightforward as initially planned
  - Task 81 ("Backend : add server API GET/PUT lecture"):
    - the edge cases of a PUT operation required more carefull thinking
  - Task 83 ("Backend: add DAO put/get method for a lecture"):
    - see task 81
  - Task 84 ("Backend: testing DAO function"):
    - lost a lot of time in setting up the testing environment
  - Task 90 ("Backend : testing teacher email notifications") [story 2 of SPRINT 2]:
    - there were more use cases to consider to reach the min coverage threshold
  - Task 94 ("Frontend Teacher Stats Page: create page component"):
    - this task was originally estimated for one person, but during the sprint we decided to allocate two people to it so the time logged results much higher than expected
  - Task 100 ("Backend : add function which computes stats"):
    - task not well defined, too general. These statistics has been computed in other parts of the application

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - POSITIVE
      - define the system APIs as a group instead of few individuals raised less issues than in the previous iterations 
      - reviewing code in group allowed us to find some minor flaws 
      - testing the code allowed us to find other minor bugs
  - NEGATIVE
      - again the time allocated, during the sprint planning, for testing was not sufficient

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - do more group discussions
  - code review
  - augment and define threshold for coverage
  - define better APIs

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - we achieved all the improvement goals

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - augment threshold for coverage (80%)
  - better discuss the design of the pages
  - reduce code duplication

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - as a team and individuals we are improving and growing everyday as developers. Furthermore the workflow is going very smoothly!
