## ASSESSMENT (in progress)

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - Task xx (task description)
    - reason
  - Task 58 ("Backend: testing delete booking server API"):
    - there were more use cases to consider to reach the min coverage threshold
  - Task 73 ("Backend: add function that notify the student when a lecture is cancelled"):
    - the notification system was not straightforward as initially planned
  - Task 81 ("Backend : add server API GET/PUT lecture"):
    - the edge cases of a PUT operation required more carefull thinking
  - Task 83 ("Backend: add DAO put/get method for a lecture"):
    - see task 81
  - Task 84 ("Backend: testing DAO function"):
    - lost a lot of time in setting up the testing environment
  - Task 90 ("Backend : testing teacher email notifications") [story 2 of SPRINT 2]:
    - there were more use cases to consider to reach the min coverage threshold

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - POSITIVE
  - NEGATIVE

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
* do more group discussions
* code review
* augment and define threshold for coverage
* define better APIs

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
